## Accurate 3D body measurements and video-based motion capture

Turn two phone photos into full-body measurements, or a short video into 3D skeletal motion — no mocap suits, scanners, or manual labeling.

## Key Benefits
- **Simple for anyone** — Take two photos or a short video with your phone, we do the rest.  
- **Accurate measurements** — Get precise, consistent body measurements without visiting a lab or fitting room.  
- **Instant motion capture** — Record natural movement on any device and get 3D skeletal output for analysis, coaching, or animation.  
- **Cost & time savings** — Replace expensive hardware, studio time, or manual annotation with automated processing.  
- **Privacy-minded & scalable** — Automated pipelines reduce human exposure to images and let businesses scale quickly.

## Use Cases
- **Retail** — Improve fit recommendations and reduce returns.  
- **Fitness & Health** — Track progress objectively from photos or video.  
- **Animation & AR** — Generate realistic, rig-ready motion without a mocap studio.  
- **Security & Analytics** — Capture posture and movement cues at scale with less infrastructure.
