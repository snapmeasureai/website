<h4 align="center"><strong>AI Training Images → Automatic Labeling → 3D Body Measurement & Motion Capture</strong></h4>

SnapMeasureAI delivers three core technologies—supported by issued and pending patents:

🧠 **Photorealistic AI‑generated images with mesh‑aligned annotations** for training<br>
📏 **AI‑driven 3D body measurements** from just two photos<br>
🎥 **3D motion capture from video**—no mocap suits, no manual labeling

These power human‑centric AI across retail, health, fitness, and security.

⚡ SnapMeasureAI generates unlimited AI images with perfectly aligned labels, letting computer vision teams train models **without human annotation**.

📐 Its advanced mesh prediction system extracts **accurate body measurements** across 10,000+ points from only **two input images**.

🏃‍♂️ For motion, the platform analyzes video to extract **3D skeletal movement** across 25+ joints—enabling full-body motion capture in seconds, replacing expensive, hardware-based systems.
