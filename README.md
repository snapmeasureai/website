<h4 align="center"><strong>Lifelike Synthetic Human Images, AI Body Measurement, and 3D Motion Analysis</strong></h3>

SnapMeasureAI delivers three core technologies—supported by issued and pending patents: photorealistic synthetic human images for AI training, 3D body measurement from just two photos, and 3D motion analysis from video—no mocap suits or manual labeling required. These solutions enable scalable human-centric AI across retail, health, fitness, and security.

SnapMeasureAI generates unlimited synthetic images with perfectly aligned labels, allowing computer vision teams to train models without human annotation. Its advanced mesh prediction system extracts accurate body measurements across 10,000+ points using only two input images.

For motion, the platform analyzes video input to extract 3D skeletal motion using over 25 joint-based skeleton outputs. This enables full-body motion tracking in seconds, replacing costly motion capture systems with a fast, flexible AI-driven alternative.
